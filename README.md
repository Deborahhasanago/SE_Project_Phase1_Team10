#III. TITLE OF THE PROJECT: Psychology Clinic Management Website
IV. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: I met up with a friend of mine who had opened her own
Psychiatric Clinic. After some discussions, I came to know that she was facing problems with
managing the records of her patients. As a newly opened business, the tools used to manage the
patient were a record book by manually kept track of the patient details and appointments. She
needed an efficient management system to keep track of her patients&#39; details and appointments.
#V. SOLUTION PROPOSAL: After some discussions, I suggested creating an interactive and user-
friendly website where the admins and the psychologists can keep track of their patients and
appointments in real time and where the information can be updated frequently.
 Features and Technologies:
 User-friendly interface: designed in a way that it is easy to navigate and operate.
 Centralized dashboard: Customized overviews for the admin and psychologist
which enables easy and rapid access.

 Automation of Patient Management: Reduction of human error and real-time
information update.
 Adjustable system: As the business grows, the architecture of the system
enables it to adjust to the needs of the business.

 Technologies: I plan to use the programming languages PHP, CSS, and JavaScript, Bootstrap.
 Backend: PHP
 Frontend: JavaScript and CSS
 Database: MySQL through xampp

#VI. PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes building a psychological clinic to efficiently manage
patient information and appointments. It will have functions including patient registration,
appointment scheduling, secure staff logins with role-based access, and electronic health
records functionality for secure data storage.

 Features and Technologies:
 User-friendly interface: designed in a way that it is easy to navigate and operate.
 Centralized dashboard: Customized overviews for the admin and psychologist which
enables easy and rapid access.
 Automation of Patient Management: Reduction of human error and real-time
information update.
 Role-based access to ensure data security and storage

 Limitations:
 Adaptation of users: Getting past any resistance to change from clinic personnel and
patients may be challenging. Sufficient training and assistance are going to be required
to ensure the successful implementation of the new system.

 Compliance with regulations: Following to privacy laws and healthcare compliance
requirements complicates matters and may limit some functionality necessary to protect
patient data from unauthorized access.

 Migration of data: Moving old patient information to the new system can be difficult
and time-consuming. Maintaining patient care continuity requires ensuring data
correctness and integrity throughout migration.

 Unexpected Technical Issues: Unexpected technical difficulties, like bugs in software
or system failures, may affect the operation of the website.
 Boundaries:
 The training and support of users: The accessibility and efficacy of training tools may
limit the speed at which users adjust to the new system. Continuous assistance in
overcoming obstacles is critical.
 Ethical and Legal Boundaries: The project has to stick to legal frameworks, especially
healthcare and data security legislation.
 Technology limitations: The selected technology architecture might come with limits
that affect the way the site works. Compliance concerns or limits inside particular
structures may define the project&#39;s technical boundaries.
 User Expertise: User choices, demands, and knowledge of technology across clinic
personnel and patients may limit the website&#39;s sophistication and design.

#VII. AIM AND OBJECTIVES:
AIM: The goal of the project is to develop an easy-to-use website for a mental health clinic
that simplifies patient administration and appointment scheduling. The purpose of offering safe
and efficient solutions for patient enrollment, booking appointments, and electronic health
record administration is to increase overall clinic productivity, interaction among patients and
staff, and compliance with regulations.
#OBJECTIVES:
 Create an easy-to-navigate interface for the administrators and the psychologist.
 Automate the record-keeping process to ensure efficiency.
 Ensure real-time information updates.
 Create electronic healthcare reports to ensure secure storage and the management of the
patient’s data.
 Incorporation of role-based access to ensure the security of patient information
#VIII. APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:
The Psychiatric Clinic Management System is an entirely web-based application that seeks to
simplify and enhance the daily activities of a psychiatric clinic. This easy-to-use system
includes elements necessary for effective patient management, appointment scheduling, and
electronic health record (EHR) management. The following are descriptions of major interfaces
and their functionalities.

 Register/Login Interface: This is the user&#39;s entrance point, where clinic staff
can log in securely. People who are new sign up using this interface. You can log
in or sign up as staff or admin.

 The Admin and Staff Interface: It will consist of dashboards that will have an
overview of appointments, patient details, and important notifications. Some of
the functionalities include displaying upcoming appointment schedules, and
direct connection to patient records.
 Patient Management Interface: This interface enables clinic staff to handle
patient data accurately and safely. It will include being able to view and change
the patient&#39;s statistics, medical history, and communication details. It is
composed of the:
- Electronic Health Records Interface: This interface enables the secure
storing and handling of medical records. It includes the creation and
update of records which can be managed by staff.
- Appointment Scheduling Interface: An interface that will manage the
appointments by using a calendar view and being able to set the type of
appointment, patient details, and the available psychologist.
