## Phase III: Software Design and Modeling

## Deadline: April 1st, 2024, 23:59

# Software Design and Modeling
# Group Name: Team 10 Deborah Hasanago
**I. Software Architecture:**
The system is built for the sole purpose of streamlining patient data and automating manual
processes, which will ensure efficiency, enhance security and reliability, and make
communication between patients and the clinic staff more practical. The system&#39;s unified
architecture enables a user-friendly interface, reliable data management, easy integration, and
data-driven choices to ensure efficient clinic management and patient satisfaction.
a) User management and authentication interfaces ensure role-based access to different
parts of the system to protect the privacy of the patient data. There are three types of
user authentication: administrator, clinician, and patient. Authentication techniques use
encrypted credentials along with safe authentication methods to verify users&#39; identities
upon login. Each user will have access to their assigned interface which will contain a
dashboard and home page where they can perform specific actions.

b) The patient management is the interface reserved for the patient upon login. Each patient can book appointments.
The database securely stores and manages patient data, such as their medical history, treatment plans,
diagnoses, and prescriptions.
c) The administrator /clinician login will be reserved for the staff of the clinic. They will be
able to overview appointments and manage them via a personalized dashboard. Another
feature of the admin/staff interface will be the patient EHRs. They will have access to
reviewing medical history, creating treatment plans, and prescribing medications. EHR
data is formatted and arranged in the database to ensure security, integrity of data, and
conformity to regulations.

**c) Database Model:**

**Effective Data Structure:**
1. Normalization: To cut down on redundancy and guarantee data integrity, the
database schema is created using normalization techniques. To prevent duplicate
patient data in different tables, for instance, patient details are kept in the Patients
Table and connected to appointments and EHRs using foreign keys.
2. Indexes: To enhance query performance and data retrieval speed, indexes are
established on frequently searched columns (such as PatientID, AppointmentID,
and ClinicianID).
3. Data Integrity Restrictions: To provide referential security, foreign key
constraints are utilized to avoid abandoned records and to sustain data
connections between tables.
4. Optimized Queries: SQL queries that are used to get, update, or remove data are
made as efficient as possible by utilizing the right joins, filters, and indexes to
reduce resource usage and enhance database performance in general.

# PHASE VI: SOFTWARE TESTING

## I. Introduction to Testing:

a) The process of analyzing a software program to find flaws or errors is called software
testing. Software testing occurs to make sure the program works as intended and satisfies
requirements. Testing is running the program with the goal of identifying bugs,
confirming that it functions as intended, and guaranteeing its dependability and quality.
b) In software development, testing is essential since it
- enhances software quality by finding vulnerabilities early.
- improves functionality and user experience.
- guarantees durability and avoids expensive mistakes.
- verifies modifications and upholds accuracy over time.
- increases stakeholder confidence.
## II. Purpose of Testing:

a) In software development, testing serves as a kind of safeguarding net, identifying
possible problems before they become significant ones. It involves ensuring that every
piece of code performs as intended and doesn&#39;t damage anything else. Testing, when done
early and often during the development cycle, guarantees that the finished product
satisfies criteria, operates dependably, and offers users a satisfying experience.

## III. Focus on Testing a Single Component:

- Role in the System: Controlling how users interact with your application is mostly
dependent on the redirect function. It manages redirects to alternative sites or URLs in
response to specific events, including form submissions, authentication status, or user

input. Thus, keeping a seamless and simple user experience depends on the redirect
function functioning well.

- Complexity: While the redirect function in and of itself may appear straightforward,
there may be untested complexity in its implementation. For instance, you must confirm
that the redirection header is appropriately sent to the browser and that the specified URL
is legitimate.
- Effect on the System: The application&#39;s behavior and functionality are directly affected
by the redirect function. The function may cause usability problems, interrupted
navigation flows, or even safety holes (such as open redirects) if it fails to correctly
redirect users or sends inappropriate headers. By identifying and preventing such
problems, testing reduces the possibility of system malfunctions or user unhappiness.
IV. Preparing Test Cases:

**a) Normal Inputs:**
- Scenario: A valid URL and a legitimate status message are supplied to the redirect
function.
- Write a test scenario in which the function gets called with a standard status message
and a known-good URL.
- Anticipated Result: Confirm that the function sets the session status appropriately
and redirects to the given URL.
**b) Edge Cases:** 
- Scenario: Examine the limits or very high thresholds for inputs that could result in
strange behavior.
- Test Case: Supply special characters in URLs, very long URLs, and empty status
messages as edge case inputs.
- Anticipated Result: Make sure the function can smoothly manage edge
circumstances, such as cutting lengthy URLs or properly handling special characters,
without crashing or resulting in unexpected outcomes.
**c) Invalid Inputs:** 
- Scenario: Evaluate the behavior of the function in the event that it receives invalid
inputs, like a blank status message or a non-URL value.
- Test Case: Give the function invalid inputs, like a blank status message or a string
that isn&#39;t a URL.
- Anticipated Result: Confirm that the function responds to invalid inputs in a suitable
manner, such as by reporting the error, returning an error message, or failing
gracefully without causing unexpected behavior.

## V. Choosing Testing Frameworks:
For a php-written application, one of the most efficient and easy-to-use testing software is
PHPUnit. It offers a wide range of assertion techniques, test case structuring, and test
execution tools. It works well for testing particular PHP codebase pieces or components.
It works well for testing certain PHP codebase pieces or components.
**How to SetUp PHPUnit:**
- As a start you need to have a compatible php version downloaded to your PC.
- Next, you need to download the PHPUnit Composer. It offers a wide range of
assertion techniques, test case structuring, and test execution tools. It works well for
testing particular PHP codebase pieces or components. Composer creates an
autoloader for smooth incorporation into your PHP project for testing, installs
PHPUnit and its dependencies, and maintains version compliance.
- After that you need to download a PHPUnit that is not outdated or not supported to
your PC.
- Opening the command prompt you will provide the path of file where you want to
test the component.
- Using “require --dev phpunit/phpunit” you can install PHPUnit&#39;s most recent stable
version that is appropriate for your project.
- And you’re ready to test.

## VI. Writing Test Code:

**Normal Input Scenario:**

It initiates a session, calls
redirect with a URL and a
status message, and checks
that, following redirection,
the session status has been
updated correctly.

Assertion: Following the
redirection procedure, the
assertEquals method
confirms that the session
state
($_SESSION[&#39;status&#39;])
corresponds to the
requested status ($status).

## VII. Running Tests:

**Putting Tests into Practice:**
- Open the terminal of the directory where the test file is located.
- Use the PHPUnit command to put your tests into action : vendor/bin/phpunit
tests/functionTest.php

**a) Passing Test:**

**b) Failing Test**
Error Scenarios
- PHPUnit Testing by
default doesn’t display
messages for when a
test is passed. It only
notifies when there is a
test failure and error
incurring. In order to
have a “TEST OK”
message is green for a
successful test you need
to download a PHPUnit
extension called
DOXTYPE which I do not
have on my PC.

## VIII. Test Coverage
High test coverage is beneficial for a number of reasons, including assisting in the identification
of untested code paths, enhancing software maintainability, boosting confidence in the
dependability of the codebase, reducing the risk of introducing regressions, and aligning with
standard practices for quality control.
